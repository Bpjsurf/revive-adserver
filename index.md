###### Andrew Hill - Illness

Dear all, I wanted to apologise for the slowness of activity on Revive Adserver
recently. I have come down with some kind of (presumed) viral infection, and
have not been able to really work on the project for the last few weeks; I am
still not better, and all expectation seems to be that it will be some weeks
(at least) before I am back on my feet. I am very sorry for the lack of action
on issues and pull requests at the current time - but I very much appreciate
the efforts that everyone is going to find and fix bugs, and make suggestions
for how to improve Revive Adserver. Please keep the updates coming in, and I
hope that I will be well enough again soon to get to the list and get through
them as soon as I possible can. - Andrew
